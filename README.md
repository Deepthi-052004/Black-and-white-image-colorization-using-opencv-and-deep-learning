# Black-and-white-image-colorization-using-opencv-and-deep-learning
This project demonstrates how to colorize black and white (grayscale) images using a pre-trained deep learning model with OpenCV. It uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) that has been trained on large datasets to predict the colors of grayscale images.
##  Features
* Converts grayscale images to color automatically
* Utilizes a pre-trained Caffe model from OpenCV's `dnn` module
* Fast and easy to use on images of various sizes
* No need to train your own model
##  Requirements

Install the following dependencies:
pip install opencv-python numpy

## Usage

python colorize.py --input input/grayscale.jpg --output output/colorized.jpg

##  How It Works

The model is based on the research paper:
> Richard Zhang, Phillip Isola, Alexei A. Efros. "Colorful Image Colorization", ECCV 2016.
It works by:

1. Converting the input image to the LAB color space
2. Using the pre-trained CNN to predict the `a` and `b` color channels
3. Combining the predicted channels with the original `L` channel to form the final colorized image
